Standard Aliases
================

Make Linux more user friendly with this collection of **Bash functions**.

It provides commands that should be in Linux by default, or just an aberrations of commands that are provided, but are so commonly used that they deserve a shorter name.

Collection was made for **Debian** based Linux (**Ubuntu**, **Mint**, ...) with **Gnome** desktop environment, but most commands will work on all systems with installed Bash shell and GNU Coreutils.

There are currently 207 commands.

How To Rename Commands
----------------------
* Check if name is already taken by running: `$ wi <name>`
* Open **`.standard_rc`** located in your home directory and add new name in front of function's description.
* Save and run: `$ bash`

How It Works
------------
After installation the "framework" consists of three files:

* [**`standard_functions`**](standard-aliases/standard_functions): It contains Bash functions with long descriptive names. It is located in projects directory.

* Users [**`.standardrc`**](standard-aliases/standard_rc) file: Configuration file that specifies short names for functions.  Also defines [options](standard-aliases/standard_rc#L323-L346) that functions use when they call specific commands. It is located in user's home directory.

* Automatically generated **`aliases`** file: Contains functions with short names that call functions with longer names, as defined in configuration file. It also assigns appropriate comand-line completions to the short functions. It is located in `~/.standard_aliases` directory.
 
Every time new Bash shell is started, the "framework" checks if any changes were made to functions or configuration file and if so, then generates new `aliases` file.

Misc
----
* Usually if function only makes Linux command easier to use, either by using a few "sensible" options, or just by sending output of a command to a pager if necessary, then it has same name as command, but with number `1` appended at the end. Some examples are: `ps1`, `pgrep1`, `tree1`, `mkdir1`. Options for this commands are defined at the bottom of [`standardrc`](standard-aliases/standard_rc#L323-L346).

* Only functions that redefine already existing commands are `cp`, `mv` and `rm`. They are all run in interactive mode, meaning you get asked for conformation before any destructive operation. If you want to execute them without this prompting, use -f (force) option. 

* Command-line completions are automatically assigned to functions, depending on what commands they use. (Exception are `git` commands, for which completions don't work.)

* Commands for accessing the framework:
	* ty
	* al 
	* sc
