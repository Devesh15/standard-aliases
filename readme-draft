Make Linux more user friendly with this collection of bash aliases.

Bash aliases are most useful device for customizing your Linux...
Here is a short list of ones i find most useful:
m
l/ll/lll
cpdir/mvdir/rmdir
rb
o
te
(ma)
mk
ty



This aliases were made for debian based linux (ubuntu, mint,...) with gnome desktop environment, but most aliases will work on all systems with bash shell.

Most aliases will send output to pager if it will be too long to fit the screen.

Some aliases require special tools that are not installed by default on most systems. You can install them all at one with command belove, but it is probably more reasonable to just install them when demand arises.

Usualy if alias only makes command easier to use, either by providing the options that should have been set by default, or by just sending output of command to pager if necesary, then it has same name as command, but with number 1 apended at the end. Some examples are:
ps1
pgrep1
tree1
mkdir1

Only aliases that override the commands are cp, mv and rm. They are all run in interactive mode, meaning you get asked for conformation before any destructive operation. If you want to execute them without this promptint, then use -f (force) option. 

If the list belowe seems too long here is a shorthened list of aliases, that I consider almost necesary:)
m
l/ll/lll
cpdir/mvdir/rmdir
rb
o
ty
te
(ma)
mk

When adding new alias alwalys check if it is already taken by any command with `wi <alias>`.


// Intentions
I know it is a bit abnockuous to think your colection of aliases is so great, that it should become adopted as standard, but what a hack, I worked on and been using them for long time, and I just feel so limited withouth them.
