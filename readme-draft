This aliases were made for debian based linux (ubuntu, mint,...) with gnome desktop environment, but most aliases will work on all systems with bash shell.

Most aliases will send output to pager if it will be too long to fit the screen.

Some aliases require special tools that are not installed by default on most systems. You can install them all with command belove, but it is probably more reasonable to just install them when demand arises.

If the list belowe seems too long here is a shorthened list of aliases, that I consider almost necesary:)
m
l/ll/lll
cpdir/mvdir/rmdir
rb
o
ty
te
(ma)
mk
